1. Calculate the individual semantics of each decision making using Lingo software.
2. Save and record the individual semantic results of the decision making.
3. Use "SJ_1_25'', "SJ_25_55" and "SJ_55" to get the evaluation matrix of decision making.
3. Use the program "YSZT" to complete both the consensus process and the alternative ranking process.
4. Use "cost'' to get the cost of the consensus process.
